# contributor milestones

Identify new contributors to a project, and track their prolificness

## Motivation

It's hard to know who is contributing to a project, and to make them feel adequately welcome.

I want to be actively notified when someone makes their first contribution, so that I can welcome them.

Then, I want to know when they reach certain milestones - second patch, 10th, 100th, and so on, so that we can
celebrate their participation over time.

## Features

* Configure the list of repositories that comprise a project (Most of the projects that I care about have more than one repo. This list can be arbitrarily long.)
* Consumes GitHub history of a project (eventualy support non-GitHub repos)
* Identify all contributors, and their first contribution
* Define "badges" for things like first contribution, first doc, 10th contribution, and so on
* Update data on a scheduled basis to identify new contributors, and new milestones reached
* Generate a "profile" page that is generated based on data from their Github profile as well as their earned badge for a given project

## Prior Work

I rather assume I'm not the first person to think of this. If you know of tools that already do this, please
speak up. I'd rather participate in a larger effort that reinvent.
